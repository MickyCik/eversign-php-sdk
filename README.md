# eversign PHP SDK

Eversign PHP SDK is the official PHP Wrapper around the eversign [API](https://eversign.com/api/documentation).


## Requirements

  - The latest version of the SDK requires PHP version 5.5 or higher.
  - Installation via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is recommended

## Installation
- Install Composer if you haven't already
   ```
   curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
   ```
- Add the eversign PHP SDK as a dependency using the composer.phar CLI:
   ```
   php composer.phar require apilayer/eversign-php-sdk:~1.0
   ```
   or add it directly to your composer.json
   ```
   {
    "require": {
      "apilayer/eversign-php-sdk": "~1.0"
    }
  }
   ```
- After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader
  ```
   require 'vendor/autoload.php';
  ```

## Usage
All eversign API requests are made using the Eversign\Client class. This class must be initialized with your Authentication Token before using anything else. All available Methods for saving, retrieving ie. can all be found inside the Client class.
  ```
   $client = new Client("MY_API_KEY");
  ```

### Creating Documents
For creating documents via the API you need to instantiate an Eversign\Document object and set your desired properties with the setter Methods provided.
  ```
   $document = new Document();
   $document->setTitle("My Title");
  ```

#### Adding signers to the Document
Ever document can have 1 or multiple signers which are required to sign the document. You can add signers to an existing Document object by instantiating the Eversign\Signer object. You then append the Signer to the Document
  ```
   $signer = new Signer();
   $signer->setName("John Doe");
   $signer->setEmail("john.doe@eversign.com");
   $signer->setRequired(true);
   $document->appendSigner($signer);
  ```

#### Adding files to the Document
Adding files to a document is also made very easy. Just create a new Eversign\File object and set the filePath, fileId (if it already exists on the API) or your own Base 64 string of the file you want to create. After creation you can append the file to a document. When the document is saved the file is automatically uploaded for you.
  ```
   $file = new File();
   $file->setName("My File");
   $file->setFilePath(getcwd() . "/file.pdf");
   $document->appendFile($file);
  ```

#### Adding FormFields
There are quite a lot different FormFields you can add to your document. Every FormField has different fields which are required for eversign to know how to handle the Field. Please check the official [FormFields Documentation](https://eversign.com/api/documentation/fields). When creating Fields that require Signers to be set, please use your provided Signer id and NOT the Signer object. While appending with appendFormField you can also specify the Index of the file as the second Parameter where the FormField should be added.
  ```
   $signatureField = new SignatureField();
   $signatureField->setX(30);
   $signatureField->setY(150);
   $signatureField->setPage(2);
   $signatureField->setRequired(true);
   $signatureField->setSigner("1");
   $document->appendFormField($signatureField);
  ```

#### Saving the Document
Saving a new Document couldn't be simpler. Just call the createDocument Method on the client with the document to be saved. After successful saving of the document the method returns the document with everything added by the API.
  ```
   $client->createDocument($document);
  ```

#### Loading a document
Loading a document requires the documentHash to be known. If thats the case its a simple call to the client
  ```
   $document = $client->getDocumentWithHash("MY_HASH");
  ```

#### Downloading the raw or final Document
There are 2 methods provided for you to download the Document, either in its signed or raw state. Just pass the Document object and a filePath where the document should be saved. Final Documents can also have an Audit Trail. Set the last parameter to true to have it attached automatically.
  ```
   $client->downloadFinalDocumentToPath($document, "final.pdf", true);
   $client->downloadRawDocumentToPath($document, "raw.pdf");
  ```

#### Get a list of Documents
Getting a list of Document Objects based on the different states (all, completed, draft, etc.) is also handled via the client. There are different distinct methods for you to choose from. The methods all return an array of Document classes
  ```
   $client->getAllDocuments();
   $client->getCompletedDocuments();
   $client->getDraftedDocuments();
  ```

#### Delete or cancel a Document
As with all other methods to the API cancel and delete are also handled through the Client class.
  ```
   $client->deleteDocument($document);
   $client->cancelDocument($document);
  ```
